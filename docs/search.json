    "text": "Data Description\nData used in this project was sourced from the Tidy Tuesday Github repository. The specific data and follwing description used can be found here: 2024-09-24: IMO Data.\n\nThe International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) is the World Championship Mathematics Competition for High School students and is held annually in a different country. The first IMO was held in 1959 in Romania, with 7 countries participating. It has gradually expanded to over 100 countries from 5 continents. The competition consists of 6 problems and is held over two consecutive days with 3 problems each.\n\n\n\nData Cleaning\n\n\n\n\n\nVisualization 1\n\nHere is a description of the first visualization. I want to describe what the visualization shows to a general audience. I do not want to see any code or technical terms. I want to be able to read this and understand what the visualization shows. I also want to see a caption and alt text for the visualization. The caption should be a short description of the visualization and the alt text should be a longer description of the visualization. The alt text should be descriptive enough that someone who is blind could understand what the visualization shows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFig. 1: Yearly mean scores for each of the 6 International Math Olympiad questions. Each question is scored from 1 to 7 points.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisualization 2\n\nHere is a description of the second visualization. I want to describe what the visualization shows to a general audience. I do not want to see any code or technical terms. I want to be able to read this and understand what the visualization shows. I also want to see a caption and alt text for the visualization. The caption should be a short description of the visualization and the alt text should be a longer description of the visualization.

Each question is scored from 1 to 7 points."
